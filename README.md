The Odin Project Site: Realmweaver

## Overview
Realmweave is an innovative web-based platform that aims to revolutionize tabletop roleplaying games by creating a living, breathing fantasy world that evolves through player actions and time progression. This project represents my journey into full-stack development, being built incrementally as I learn new skills through The Odin Project curriculum.

## Vision
Create a platform where:

* Worlds evolve through collective player actions  
* Characters progress beyond traditional combat roles  
* Players face adversaries with depth and purpose
* Parties craft unforgettable stories together
* Dungeon Masters focus on creativity while systems handle complexity

## Development Journey
This project grows alongside my learning journey. Each new concept I master through The Odin Project is applied to expand and improve Realmweaver's functionality.

## Future Development Plans
As I continue learning, I plan to implement:

* Interactive world map
* Character management systems
* Campaign management system
* Real-time party collaboration features
* Dynamic event system
* Economic and political systems
* A proprietary gaming world and system
